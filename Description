pyFormex is a program for generating, transforming and manipulating large
geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical
operations. Unlike traditional CAD systems, pyFormex uses a powerful
(Python based) scripting language as the basic user input method, making
it very well suited for automated and repeated (parametric) design
procedures. It provides a wide range of operations on surface meshes,
like STL type triangulated surfaces, and FEA meshes or CFD grids.
There is also support for Nurbs curves and surfaces.

pyFormex is often used to create 3D models from medical scan images,
or as a pre- and post-processor for FEA programs.
But it can just as well be used to create some nice 3D renderings.
The fully open scripting allows you to do just about anything, including
interfacing with many other softwares. You are only limited by your own
imagination.

In pyFormex, the topology of the elements can be unlinked from the final
geometrical form. Often, topology is created first and then mapped onto some
geometry. Through the scripting language, the user can define any sequence
of transformations, built from provided or user defined functions.
Since the model is stored as a script, building parametric models is a
natural thing.

While pyFormex is still under `development`_, it already provides a
fairly stable scripting language and an OpenGL GUI environment for
displaying, manipulating and exporting the generated structures.
