Installation procedure for GTS utilities
========================================

The 'TriSurface' objects in pyFormex can make use of some powerful features
of the GTS (GNU Triangulated Surfaces) library. To interface with this library
you need to compile and install the programs in this directory.

You need to have the GTS and glib libraries installed, including the
development files, and the pkg-config program.
Packages for these are available for most Linux distributions.
On Debian and like systems (Ubuntu) you just need to::
  apt-get install libgts-dev libglib2.0-dev pkg-config

To build the manpage, you also need python-docutils::
  apt-get install python-docutils

And you need git (which you probably already have if you run pyFormex
directly from source, but might not if you installed from tarball)::
  apt-get install git

Then compile and install the programs with::
  make
  (sudo) make install

The default install is under '/usr/local/' and requires root privileges.

Afterwards, you can clean up with::
  make clean

Or do it all at once with::
  make all
